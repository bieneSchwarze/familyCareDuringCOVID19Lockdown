Here you can find the source code of the R programs used for data analysis for the manuscript 
**"Family care during the COVID-19 lockdown: determinants and consequences for subjective well-being and health"** 
by Katja MÃ¶hring, Sabine Zinn, Ulrike Ehrlich.

The source codes can be found in two data files: 
one for data preparation and panel analysis for 2018/2019 (*dataPreparation_analysis_2018_2019.R*) and one for data preparation and panel analysis 2019/2020 (*dataPreparation_analysis_2019_2020.R*).

The data used for 2018 and 2019 is avaiable on request form the SOEP data center (https://www.diw.de/en/diw_01.c.678568.en/research_data_center_soep.html), SUF v36. 
The data used for 2019 and 2020 stems from a special Corona study of the SOEP (SOEP-CoV) and is not yet available. The reason is that the correspeonding project is third-party funded. 
The data will be made available to the scientific community in 2022 with the regular next data release of the annual SOEP waves.
