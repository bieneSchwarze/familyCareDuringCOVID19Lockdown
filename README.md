**"Family care during the COVID-19 lockdown: determinants and consequences for subjective well-being and health"** 
by Katja MÃ¶hring, Sabine Zinn, Ulrike Ehrlich.

The Hypotheses which are tested are
* Hypothesis 1 
(a) "Those providing family care will experience a larger decline in well-being (more depressive symptoms, less life satisfaction) during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2019 than those not providing family care", 
(b) "Those providing family care will experience no change, or an increase in well-being (depressive symptoms, life satisfaction) during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2019"
* Hypothesis 2 
(a) "the relationship between family care provision and well-being is moderated by the family care pattern: the decline in well-being (i.e., more depressive symptoms, less life satisfaction) will be more severe for those newly taking up family care responsibilities", 
(b) "while continuing family caregivers will experience no change or even an increase in well-being"
* Hypothesis 3
The relationship between informal care provision and well-being will be moderated by care intensity with the decline in well-being being more severe for those caregivers who increased their care hours 

The source codes can be found in six data files: 
- one for data preparation and panel analysis for 2018/2019 (*dataPrep_InfCare_2018_2019.R*) and one for data preparation and panel analysis 2019/2020 (*dataPrep_InfCare_2019_2020.R*),
- one for estimating the models for testing the hypotheses 1 and 2: for 2018/2019 (*model_FD_Hyp1and2_2018_2019.R*) and one for 2019/2020 (*model_FD_Hyp1and2_2019_2020.R*), 
- one for estimating the models for testing the hypothesis 3: for 2018/2019 (*model_FD_Hyp3_2018_2019.R*) and one for 2019/2020 (*model_FD_Hyp3_2019_2020.R*).

The data used for 2018 and 2019 is avaiable on request form the SOEP data center (https://www.diw.de/en/diw_01.c.678568.en/research_data_center_soep.html). 
The data used for 2019 and 2020 stems from a special Corona study of the SOEP (SOEP-CoV) and is also available form the SOEP data center. All data is part of SUF v37.
